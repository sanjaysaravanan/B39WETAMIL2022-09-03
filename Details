Topics:
  Anonymous Function ---> A function without any name
  IIFE --> Immediately Invoked Function Expression

  Plural --> Multiple Items or More than One
  Array Methods: 
    callback function accepts parameters (value, index, array)
    value --> element of array on each iteration
    index --> index of the elemen on each iteration
    array --> Complate array on top of which the forEach is been called

    forEach
      1. simply iterates and executes the passed function
      2. No Return type
    
    Map --> 
      1. iterates and accumulates the return of the passed function into a new Array. if no return in the function then undefined will be accumulated as new array
      2. Return an array same length

    Filter --> Takes a function which returns true or false condition 
      based on which the elements of the array will accumulated into a new array

    Find --> Takes a function which returns true or false condition
      based on which return the first element of the array which matches condition

    FindIndex --> Takes a function which returns true or false condition
      based on which return the index of the first element of the array which matches condition
      returns -1 when no elements matches the condition

    findLast --> 
      return the array last array element which matches the condition
      returns undefined when no elements matches the condition
    
    findLastIndex --> 
      return the array last index of the  array element which matches the condition
      returns -1 when no elements matches the condition

    includes
      true when Item is present else false

    indexOf
      returns index of an element else -1

    Push:
      insert an element at the end/next available index of the array
      
    Pop:
      Removes the last element of the array returns the removed item

    Splice:
      Removes an element from an index
    
    Reverse:
      Reverses the entire array of elements

    Join:
      Join the elements of the array with a pattern in-between
      avoid using an array with composite elements
